# Huffman Algorithm Implementation in Python:
This project provides a Python implementation of the Huffman algorithm for lossless data compression. Huffman coding is a widely-used method for encoding variable-length symbols with differing frequencies. It accomplishes this by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols.

## Features:
Compression: Compresses input text files using the Huffman algorithm.

Decompression: Decompresses previously compressed files back to their original form.

Efficient Encoding: Utilizes a binary tree structure to efficiently encode and decode text data.

## Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.

No additional dependencies are required.
## Usage
To compress a text file, run the following command:

    python huffman.py input.txt compressed.huff
Replace input.txt with the path to your input text file and compressed.huff with the desired output file name for the compressed data.

To decompress a compressed file, use the following command:

    python huffman.py compressed.huff decompressed.txt
This will decompress the compressed.huff file and save the result as decompressed.txt.

## Example:
Suppose you have a text file named sample.txt with the following content:

    This is a sample text file for Huffman compression.
After compressing the file using the Huffman algorithm, you will get a file named compressed.huff. Upon decompression, you'll obtain a file identical to the original sample.txt.

This implementation was inspired by the Huffman coding algorithm introduced by David A. Huffman in 1952. Special thanks to OpenAI for providing the environment to develop and share this project.
